* Introduction
This document specifies the busses that connect to the communication
subsystem in the Simulink model. 4 bytes correspond to a Java integer,
and 8 bytes to a Java long.


* Sensor Fusion Bus
This bus contains all data related to the sensor fusion subsystem.
There will be two identical buses, one from the sensor fusion system
to the communication, and one in the other direction.

* Application Bus
There are two busses connecting the communication system to the
application running the current scenario:
- Application Data Bus
- Application Control Bus

The application data bus contains all data needed for communication.
The application control bus is used to instruct the communication
system to create a specific message.

In order to send a specific message, the following steps
must be performed:
1. Make sure all required data for the message is present on the
   application data bus.
2. Set the correct value on the application control bus for the
   desired message.
