* Introduction
This document presents the local message set (LMS) to be used for
GCDC16. LMS will be used by the sensor fusion system to generate CAM
messages, and by the scenario control models to generate DENM/iGAME
messages.

The communication stack includes a vehicle adapter that will receive
these messages and use them to create proper CAM/DENM/iGAME messages
that will be forwarded to other vehicles. The LMS follows the ETSI
specification as closely as possible, but makes some changes to make
is possible to create the messages in Simulink.

Different network ports will be used for CAM/DENM/iGAME messages in
order to distinguish them.

All data is in network byte order, which is identical to big endian.

* CAM
- How is time measured? How is an Instant defined?
- Define:
  - Time, Instant
  - curvature
  - yawRate
  - headingDegreesFromNorth

CAM consists of a single large message that is sent to the
communication stack periodically. The communication stack will pick up
the message and make a decision on what parts of the message to forward
to other vehicles. The message should contain the specified data, in
the specified order. Data marked as N/A should be all zeroes.

*** timestamp
 Time according to the TAI spec. From
 http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/time.html:
 TAI = International Atomic Time (Temps Atomique International = TAI) is
      defined as the weighted average of the time kept by about 200
      atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.
      TAI-UT1 was approximately 0 on 1958 Jan 1.

GPS time = TAI - 19 seconds

This is to account for leap seconds, which are not added to GPS time.
The time is sent as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

*** headingDegreesFromNorth
Heading is sent as an unsigned units of 0.1 degrees from North.
  
* DENM
DENM messages are sent on-demand. D3.2 describes four different DENM
messages, but due to how DENM messages are structured with several
data containers in every message, it turns out that there are only two
distinct messages.

The LMS for DENM messages follows the specification very loosely as
it's not worth the time to implement the full standard when only two
distinct messages are used.

will be presented in a future release of this document.
